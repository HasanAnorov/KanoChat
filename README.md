# üì° KanoMessenger

**KanoMessenger** is a mobile application for **local communication without using the Internet**.  
It enables text, audio, and file messaging inside a private LAN using **three different connection methods**, giving you flexible offline chat and sharing.

Built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and low-level **socket networking**.

---

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance
- **Three Local Communication Modes**
  - **Local-Only Hotspot**: temporary Wi-Fi access point without Internet sharing.
  - **Group Networking**: Wi-Fi Direct group owner for configurable multi-device LAN.
  - **Peer Networking**: quick P2P links between two devices.
- **Rich Messaging**
  - Send **text, emojis, photos, contacts, files**, and **voice messages**.
  - Real-time chat with online/offline presence.
- **Flexible Networking**
  - Configurable hotspot name & password.
  - Custom proxy port for server connections.
  - Shows server address, connection status, and connected devices.
- **User Experience**
  - Multi-language support.
  - Light/Dark theme toggle.
  - Adjustable broadcast frequency (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz).

## üõ† Upcoming Features

KanoMessenger is actively evolving. Two major features currently in development:

- **Mesh Networking**  
  Build a resilient local mesh network so that devices can relay messages for each other.  
  This will extend the range of local communication beyond a single hotspot or Wi-Fi Direct group, enabling true peer-to-peer coverage across larger areas.

- **Local Audio & Video Calling**  
  Real-time **voice and video calls** inside the same local network, with no Internet required.  
  This will complement text and file messaging with richer communication options.

Core of KanoMessenger: choose how to establish an offline network.

**Communication Methods**

1. **Start Local-Only Hotspot**  
   - Uses Android‚Äôs `LocalOnlyHotspot` API.  
   - Creates a temporary Wi-Fi hotspot (no Internet).  
   - Other devices join to send/receive data.  
   - Range ~100 m.  
   - Quick backup method, no manual SSID/password configuration.

2. **Group Networking (recommended)**  
   - Uses Wi-Fi Direct (`WifiP2pManager`).  
   - One device becomes Group Owner (like a router, no Internet).  
   - Configurable **network name and password**.  
   - Range ~100‚Äì200 m.

3. **Peer Networking**  
   - Device-to-device link via Wi-Fi Direct peer discovery.  
   - Good for quick file transfers or direct pairing.  
   - Range ~200 m outdoors.

Additional info shown on this page:
- **Hotspot Name & Password** (if created)
- **Wi-Fi Status** and **Networking Status**
- **Available Wi-Fi Networks** list for peer discovery

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Connections (third tab)
| Connection Idle | Connection created as Server | 
|-----------:|:-----------:|
| <img src="https://github.com/HasanAnorov/KanoMessenger/blob/feature/server/app/src/main/screenshots/connections.png" width="250" alt="Connection Idle"> | <img src="https://github.com/HasanAnorov/KanoMessenger/blob/feature/server/app/src/main/screenshots/connection_server.png" width="250" alt="Connection created as Server"> |

Where actual messaging sockets are created.

- **Create Server**: start a socket server (configure custom port to avoid conflicts).  
- **Connect**: join as a client to an existing server.  
- **Connection Details**: live status, server IP address, and list of connected devices.

This tab powers all real-time messaging once devices are on the same network.
